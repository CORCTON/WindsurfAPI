 * Client-identity neutralization for upstream requests.
 *
 * Devin's upstream applies two gates against competitor coding-agent traffic:
 *   - a 529 competitor-fingerprint gate on self-identification strings, and
 *   - a content-policy `permission_denied` block (2026-07-10, live-confirmed)
 *     that trips on Claude Code's Agent-SDK self-identification line.
 * This module rewrites those fingerprints in the system prompt BODY to a generic
 * assistant identity so the request is served instead of blocked.
 *
 * Standalone ON PURPOSE: it is imported by BOTH handlers/messages.js (the
 * /v1/messages → anthropicToOpenAI path) AND handlers/chat.js (the DEVIN_CONNECT
 * public egress). messages.js imports chat.js, so keeping this in its own module is
 * what lets chat.js reuse it without a circular import. It used to be
 * dependency-free as well; it now imports `log` from ../config.js, which cannot
 * reintroduce a cycle (config.js imports only node builtins) and adds no new
 * import-time side effect (both call sites already import config.js).
 *
 * SPANS ARE PARAGRAPH-BOUNDED. The multi-line rules below (security paragraph,
 * brand block, model catalogue) used `[\s\S]*?`, which crosses blank lines: with
 * only the two anchor phrases present, EVERY byte between them was deleted,
 * including the caller's own instructions. Measured on c3ac2b2 with the brand-block
 * anchors two paragraphs apart: 213 bytes in, 59 out — two user security rules
 * ("the API key must never be logged", "Never delete the production database")
 * silently gone. Same shape on the catalogue anchors: 208 in, 18 out. Those spans
 * now use WITHIN_PARAGRAPH, so a match cannot reach past a blank line, and every
 * substitution's byte delta is checked against OVER_DELETION_WARN_BYTES so an
 * over-large deletion is at least visible to an operator.
 *
 * Off-switch: WINDSURFAPI_NEUTRALIZE_CLIENT_ID=0 (default on).
 * Opt-in (speculative): WINDSURFAPI_NEUTRALIZE_CLINE_OBJECTIVE=1 (default off) —
 * enables the (a6-cline-obj) OBJECTIVE-boast rule; see comment at the a6-cline-obj rule.
 * Opt-in (speculative): WINDSURFAPI_NEUTRALIZE_CC_AGGRESSIVE=1 or opts.ccActive
 *   (default off) — reserved hook for Claude-Code-specific aggressive rules; see
 *   the (cc) block at the end. Currently EMPTY on purpose (a1-a4 already cover
 *   every live-confirmed CC trigger); the hook exists so a new CC trigger can be
 *   flipped on the instant a repetition A/B proves it, without re-plumbing.
 *
 * @param {string} text  system-prompt body to neutralize
 * @param {object} env   environment (injectable for tests)
 * @param {object} opts  { ccActive?: boolean } — Claude Code compat layer active

   * fire when the text SHRINKS, and the one rule that rewrites a bare token —
   * a7-freeform, FREEFORM(8B) -> free-form(9B) — GROWS by one byte per hit, so
   * `removed` is -1 and no threshold in the world catches it. MEASURED damage while
   * it was silent:
   *     CHECK (kind IN ('FREEFORM','STRUCTURED'))  ->  ('free-form','STRUCTURED')
   *     if (mode === FREEFORM)                     ->  mode === free-form
   * The first rewrites a string literal inside a data contract; the second is not
   * valid code. Neither shrinks the prompt, so the guard added for the unbounded-regex
   * over-deletion defect could not see either.
   *
   * The growth direction is counted in OCCURRENCES, not bytes. A byte threshold in
   * this direction is the wrong instrument twice over: a single-byte-per-hit rewrite
   * never reaches any useful byte figure, while an ordinary identity rewrite
   * (a4-cli-line replaces a clause with a longer sentence) trivially exceeds one and
   * would warn on every well-behaved request — training operators to ignore the line,
   * which is the failure mode this is supposed to prevent. What distinguishes
   * a7-freeform is that it is a GLOBAL BARE-TOKEN rule: it can hit an unbounded number
   * of times in text it was never aimed at. So the signal is "this rule fired more
   * times than a self-identification phrase plausibly appears".
   *
   * The deletion branch is byte-for-byte unchanged, so the W2 guard it was written for
   * still holds exactly as before.
