// Who gets blamed for a failed DEVIN_CONNECT request.
//
// finalizeConnectAccount's job is to separate "this ACCOUNT is bad" from "this
// REQUEST was bad". Getting it wrong in the second direction is expensive: a
// caller looping on a request the upstream always rejects walks the whole pool
// offline, three errors at a time, and the status flip is persisted to
// accounts.json so a restart does not undo it.
//
// That exact bug was fixed once for CONTENT_BLOCKED (upstream rejected the prompt)
// and MODEL_BLOCKED (tier wall). UPSTREAM_ERROR was missed: it carries the gRPC
// `internal` class, which classifyUpstreamError itself documents as "PERMANENT
// client mistakes (short fingerprint, gzipped request body) — fails identically
// every retry". The session token is alive and the account is healthy, yet it fell
// through to the generic reportError and got evicted.
//
// The eviction only shows up when a healthy peer exists — a single-account pool is
// covered by the last-account exemption, which is why this went unnoticed.

// The bug above happened TWICE for the same structural reason: the classification
// ends in a bare `else reportError(apiKey)`, so any error code nobody thought about
// is silently treated as an account fault and evicts healthy accounts. First
// STREAM_TRUNCATED landed there, then TIMEOUT / DEADLINE_EXCEEDED / NO_TOKEN.
//
// A behavioural test cannot catch the NEXT one — the code that will land there
// hasn't been written yet. So this guard reads both sources and fails when
// devin-connect.js can emit a code that finalizeConnectAccount does not classify.

  //  (b) codes it never constructs but happily propagates — Node's socket codes
  //      and the lowercase gRPC statuses. These arrive with `.code` already set
  //      and travel through the connect generator untouched.
  //
  // (b) is why the first version of this guard was blind to the largest class of
  // codes that actually reached the fallthrough: it read only `code: 'X'` literals
  // with an [A-Z_] character class, so ECONNRESET / ETIMEDOUT / EPIPE /
  // ECONNREFUSED were invisible AND a lowercase status like `unavailable` could
  // not match at all. Measured, healthy peer seeded: three of each flipped the
  // account to status='error'. The guard reported emitted.size = 12 and passed.
  //
  // devin-connect.js's own RETRYABLE_CODES list is the authoritative enumeration of
  // (b): it exists precisely because the transport layer already decided these are
  // retryable transport conditions, which is incompatible with blaming the account.
