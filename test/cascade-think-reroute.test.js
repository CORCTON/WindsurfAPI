// #250 on the CASCADE stream path: leading think-tagged CONTENT must be rerouted
// into the reasoning channel.
//
// WHY THIS PATH, SPECIFICALLY
//
// The reroute defense shipped in the connect layer only
// (src/devin-connect-openai.js:241, gated DEVIN_CONNECT_THINKTEXT_REROUTE). The
// Cascade path had none — and Cascade is the flow the README's recommended config
// points Claude Code at, so it carries most of the traffic the issue affects. A
// leak the client stores as visible assistant text gets resent next turn, which
// re-primes more reasoning-as-text: the self-reinforcing loop the classifier
// exists to break. Fixing only the quieter path relocates the bug.
//
// These are BEHAVIOUR tests, not source greps. The interception point sits inside
// streamResponse's `emitContent` closure, and the only honest way to prove a
// closure-local transform fires is to drive a real stream and read the bytes off
// the wire. chat.js has ReferenceError'd inside this exact region before — the
// error-path `chunk(...)` call fixed alongside this change was an undefined
// function swallowed by a try/catch, invisible to every grep (see the last case
// in this file). Reading `delta.content` from the SSE body is the assertion that
// cannot be fooled that way.
