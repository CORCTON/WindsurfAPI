// A stream that died mid-answer must not read as complete on ANY internal route.
//
// When a Cascade stream fails AFTER already delivering content, chat.js closes it
// with a FABRICATED finish_reason:'stop' — injecting the error as a content delta
// would corrupt the assistant message, so a clean close is the right wire shape for
// a direct OpenAI client. But all three internal translators guard against exactly
// this case, and all three keyed that guard on "did a terminal signal arrive". The
// synthetic close satisfied it.
//
// v3.9.2 fixed ONE of the three (responses). This file exists because that is the
// FOURTH occurrence of this repo's "fix covered only some routes" trap — and this
// time the incomplete fix was in the fix itself. So the guard is written per-route
// and asserts the WHOLE set, not one path.
//
// Two entry points had to be closed on messages/gemini, not one:
//   1. the synthetic finish_reason frame, and
//   2. the bare `[DONE]` sentinel — chat.js writes it on the truncated path too.
// Plugging only (1) leaves the guard defeated via (2). Both are covered below.
