//
// b-security, a4-brand-span and a4-catalogue matched `<anchor>[\s\S]*?<terminator>`.

// in between was replaced. Anything the client had written there went with it.
//
// Measured on master c3ac2b2, brand-block anchors two paragraphs apart:
//
//   in  213 bytes: "Claude Code is available as a CLI tool and can be used
//                   interactively.\n\nRULE 7: the API key must never be logged.\n
//                   Never delete the production database.\n\nThese models are
//                   available on Opus 4.8/4.6.\n\nNow do the task."
//   out  59 bytes: "This coding assistant runs in a terminal.\n\nNow do the task."
//
// Both of the user's own security rules, silently gone. The catalogue anchors were
// worse — 208 bytes in, 18 out. Neutralization is ON by default
// (WINDSURFAPI_NEUTRALIZE_CLIENT_ID defaults to '1') and the module logged nothing at
// all, so no operator could see it happen.
//
// Two things are asserted here, and the second matters as much as the first:
//
//   1. a span cannot cross a blank line (this file's namesake), AND the passages the
//      529 / content-policy defence exists to remove are STILL removed — bounding a
//      span is only a fix if the defence survives it. Those negative controls are the
//      reason the 49 tests in client-identity-neutralize.test.js and
//      identity-neutralize-shapes.test.js are the specification, not this file.
//   2. an over-large single substitution reaches the operator as a WARN carrying the
//      real byte delta, and an ordinary prompt logs NOTHING (a line per request is
//      noise, and noise gets filtered, which is the same as not logging).
