// Structural guard: the `modelKey=null` trap on the DEVIN_CONNECT path.
//
// Connect selection always calls getApiKey(triedKeys, null, callerKey, selector)
// — modelKey is null because connect selectors live in a different namespace from
// the Cascade catalog. isRateLimitedForModel only consults _modelRateLimits when
// modelKey is truthy, so ANY per-model state written under the client-facing model
// name is structurally invisible to connect selection.
//
// This has now bitten three times:
//   #224  RATE_LIMITED wrote a model-scoped cooldown → pool re-picked the 429'd
//         account seconds later, hammering the upstream velocity limiter.
//   #230  the sticky binding had to be WRITTEN with modelKey=null or the lookup
//         (which asks for `caller\0*`) would silently never resolve.
//   v3.8.0 CAPACITY wrote its 60s cooldown under reqModelName → invisible, so the
//         window never applied and sticky re-pinned the overloaded account.
//
// These tests are the tripwire for a fourth occurrence — but only partly, and the
// distinction matters:
//
//   * The behavioural half below writes each cooldown BY HAND via markRateLimited
//     and asserts auth.js honours it. That covers the auth-side dimension logic.
//     It does NOT cover which dimension chat.js chooses, which is what was
//     actually wrong all three times above.
//   * The source half slices chat.js lexically. Measured: moving the CAPACITY
//     write into a helper declared after `waitForAccount` — same defect, same
//     reversed `model || selector` — leaves this whole file at 10/10.
//
// `connect-dimension-behaviour.test.js` closes that gap by driving the real
// `finalizeConnectAccount` and asserting the pool outcome, with `model` and
// `selector` deliberately different (they are the same string in the tests below,
// so a write in either dimension looks identical here). Both files are kept: this
// one also enforces "no new call site in the slice picks a bad dimension", which
// is a real and different property.
